# OpenRCT2/OpenGraphics

**OpenGraphics** is a project established to replace the base graphics of Rollercoaster Tycoon 2. The aim is to create a set of freely-useable graphics that can be used with [OpenRCT2](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2), to decouple its reliance on the copyrighted material from the original game and allow anyone to play the game for free.

## Getting Started

It is best to start by reading [the "Building a Ride" tutorial on the wiki.](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenGraphics/wiki/Building-a-ride)\*

\*The exact rendering process is being worked on. You can already help by creating 3D models. If you have experience with art or plugin creation than consider checking out our discussions about esteblashing the rendering process.

## Chat

You can get in touch with us via the OpenRCT2 Discord server. There is a dedicated OpenGraphics channel that can be used to discuss this sub-project.

## Progress

Replacing every single sprite from RCT2 is a huge project. There are hundreds of thousands of sprites that need to be replaced, and this project is only just starting. Several contributors have experimented with different approaches and we're currently discussing how we can combine our efforts to create an efficient and faitful pipeline.
